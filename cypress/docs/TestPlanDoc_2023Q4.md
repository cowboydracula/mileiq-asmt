# Test Plan for Signup and Login Processes

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the test strategy and approach for testing the Signup and Login functionalities of the JSP(dot)NET Core web application. The tests will be implemented using Cypress v13.4.0 with TypeScript, sorry-cypress, and Cucumber.

## 2. Test Items
- **Signup Process**
- **Login Process**

## 3. Features to be Tested
- User can sign up with valid credentials.
- User can log in with valid credentials.
- Input validation for both Signup and Login forms.
- Handling of invalid inputs and error conditions.
- Edge cases handling in both processes.

## 4. Features Not to be Tested
- Performance testing is out of scope.
- Third-party integrations, unless directly involved in the signup or login process.

## 5. Approach
The testing approach will include:
- **Unit Tests**: To validate individual components and functions.
- **API Tests**: To ensure the backend APIs for signup and login function as expected.
- **Component Tests**: To test the individual React components in isolation.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Using Cypress with Cucumber to simulate user interactions and validate the overall flow.

## 6. Item Pass/Fail Criteria
- A test item is considered a 'pass' if it meets the acceptance criteria defined in the requirements.
- A test item is considered a 'fail' if it does not meet one or more of the acceptance criteria.

## 7. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
- Testing will be suspended if a critical defect that blocks further testing is discovered. Testing will resume once the defect is resolved.

## 8. Test Deliverables
- Test Plan Document
- Test Cases and Scripts
- Test Execution Reports
- Defect Reports

## 9. Testing Tasks
- Setup test environment and tools.
- Develop and review test cases.
- Execute tests.
- Log and retest defects.
- Generate test reports.

## 10. Environmental Needs
- Test environment set up with JSP(dot)NET Core.
- Cypress with TypeScript, sorry-cypress, and Cucumber installed.
- Access to the database for test data setup and verification.

## 11. Responsibilities
- **Test Manager**: Oversee the entire testing process.
- **QA Engineers**: Develop and execute test cases.
- **Developers**: Provide support for understanding functionalities and resolving defects.

## 12. Schedule
The testing schedule will be aligned with the project's development sprints. Specific dates will be determined as part of the sprint planning.

## 13. Risks and Contingencies
- **Risk**: Unavailability of key resources.
  **Mitigation**: Cross-training team members.
- **Risk**: Changes in requirements.
  **Mitigation**: Regular communication with stakeholders and agile adaptation.
